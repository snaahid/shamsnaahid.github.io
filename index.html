“Recipe for success: Study while others are sleeping; work while others are loafing; prepare while others are playing; and dream while others are wishing.” 
                                                                                                                                           - William A. Ward 

“There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work learning from failure.” 
                                                                                                                                            - General Colin Powell

“Everything you want is out there waiting for you to ask. Everything you want also wants you. But you have to take action to get it.” 
                                                                                                                                             -Jules Renard
